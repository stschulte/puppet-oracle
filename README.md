### oratab

The oratab file stores information about the home directory of your databases and whether
the different instances should be automatically started and stopped by the dbstart and
dbshut scripts or not.

The oratab type now allows you to treat a single entry as a resource:

    oratab { 'PROD_DB':
      ensure => present,
      home   => '/u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1',
      atboot => yes,
    }

The example above will lead to the following entry in the file `/etc/oratab` (or `/var/opt/oracle/oratab` on Solaris)

    PROD_DB:/u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1:Y

You can also specify an inline comment with the description property. This is however optional.

    oratab { 'PROD_DB':
      ensure      => present,
      home        => '/u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1',
      atboot      => yes,
      description => 'managed by puppet'
    }

will lead to

    PROD_DB:/u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1:Y # managed by puppet

If you do not specifiy the description property, puppet will not touch the current inline comment.
This might interest you because newer versions of oracle always update the comment as
`line added by agent` on each instance stop and start.
